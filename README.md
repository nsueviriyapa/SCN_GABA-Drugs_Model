# SCN_GABA-Drugs_model
This repository will contain MATLAB codes written for the networked SCN oscillator model with the detailed GABAergic system and pharmacological control applications.  Updates in progress.  Remark: The MATLAB files will be made publicly accessible once the research work has been submitted for review by the journal and officially accepted for publication.
